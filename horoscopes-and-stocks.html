                                        In the vast expanse of human endeavors, stocks and horoscopes may appear poles apart, but scratch beneath the surface, and intriguing parallels emerge. Both realms, though seemingly simple at a glance, become intricate tapestries of patterns and interpretations upon closer inspection. At their core, they resonate with the rhythms of human behavior, grounded in statistics and shrouded in layers of mysticism. So, have you ever wondered if the alignment of the stars has any sway over the world of finance? <br><br>

                                        This project, born from a blend of curiosity and amusement, dives into the tantalizing possibility of a correlation between daily horoscopes and stock market trends. While aficionados of both the stock market and astrology might raise eyebrows and offer a myriad of arguments, it's essential to remember: this exploration is pursued in the spirit of fun. So, without further ado, here are my findings: <br><br>

                                    <h4 class="text-uppercase"><a href="blog-single.html">Data Description and Preperation</a></h4>

                                    <p style="font-size:20px">
										For this playful endeavor, I began with two datasets in hand: daily horoscope readings and stock market data (you can find my resources in the titles of the datasets). 

									</p>

                        					<p style="font-size:20px"> 
                        						The horoscope dataset consists 12,946 rows, between the dates 1-Dec-2013 to 31-Dec-2016, each row representing a daily reading for the various zodiac signs. Key attributes include the date, zodiac sign, and the horoscope text. After cleaning up null values and converting the date value, I had to turn these horoscope texts into numerical values in order to compare it with the stock values. For this task I have used two different sentiment analysis techniques: Huggingface's Roberta and NLTK module's bag-of-words approach, Vader.

                        						The stock market dataset comprises a staggering 20,973,889 entries, detailing daily stock movements between 1970 and 2018. Among the plethora of metrics this dataset offered, my focus was primarily on the adjusted close and high price points. By calculating the daily percentage change in the stock's price from one day to the next and then normalizing these values between -1 and 1, I procured a measure that could be juxtaposed with my sentiment analysis results.
                        					</p>

                        				Merging these two datasets in corresponding dates and removing the unnecessary data (such as horoscope text and open prices, etc.) has given me a more concise dataset to work with. So without any further detail I decided to look for correlation between stock mesurements and the horoscope sentiments.

			                        <p style="font-size: 20px">
			                        	While the two different sentiment analysis tools seemed to be consistent in their outputs, It became evident that there were no correlation to be drawn between these daily horoscope readings and stock movements. It means that it was time for me to look deeper into my data.<br>
			                    	</p>

                                    <h4 class="text-uppercase"><a href="blog-single.html">Data Analysis and Visualisation</a></h4>

			                        <p style="font-size: 20px">
										Using sentiment analysis tools such as Roberta and Vader, each horoscope was categorized into one of three sentiments: positive, neutral, or negative. However, the values these tools assign to a given sentence might not directly correlate with the prediction of the day's quality. To avoid potential misinterpretations within the data, I chose to compare values based solely on whether they were above or below 0. Thus, on days when a positive sentiment aligned with a market rise (and conversely, when a negative sentiment coincided with a market drop), the horoscope was deemed "correct" for that day

										In the initial stages, a granular, day-to-day analysis revealed an accuracy rate of about 50%, akin to the expected outcome of a coin flip. In simpler terms, on a day-to-day basis, it seemed horoscope sentiments might not be more predictive than mere chance.
									</p>

			                        <div class="full-width">
			                            <img src="assets\img\stocks-and-horoscopes\daily_rate.jpg" alt="" />
			                        </div>

			                        <p style="font-size: 20px">

										I was very underwhelmed with the result so I decided to push further. What if, instead of individual days, I considered broader intervals? After all I have found many instances of daily horoscopes talking about "in a few days" or "in the forseable future". Averaging out sentiments and market movements over 2-day, 3-day, and even up to 30-day intervals produced a surprising observation: the accuracy rate leapt from the initial 50% to an intriguing 80%!

									</p>

			                        <div class="full-width">
			                            <img src="assets\img\stocks-and-horoscopes\30_day_rate.jpg" alt="" />
			                        </div>

			                        <p style="font-size: 20px">

										While this has made me very excited, shuffling the signs and repeating the analysis yielded similar results. To understand this trend I considered various explanations. It all came down to the fact that grouping the days together, short-term market fluctuations, which are often noisy, get averaged out, revealing more general, overarching trends. And hitorically, stock markets have shown a tendency to rise over longer periods. Hence, these broader groupings naturally capture this overall bullish tendency, making it align more closely with generally positive sentiments. Larger groupings ensure that extreme outliers have a diminished impact, leading to more stable, predictable patterns.<br>


										Motivated by these insights, I opted for a fresh strategy. I resolved to focus solely on horoscope readings that conveyed either very positive or very negative sentiments. This selective approach allowed for greater precision in classifying daily horoscope texts and offered a clearer trajectory toward a viable practical application.

									<p style="font-size: 20px">

										As I failed to find a correlation between these values, I decided to prepare a comrehensive report that may be an inspiration for me or others in the future to analyse this concept in different ways. You can reach that dashboard from <a href="https://github.com/mervemalli97/stocks-and-their-horoscopes/blob/main/Dashboard.ipynb" style="color: blue">here</a>.

										In the realm of data science and analytics, sometimes the most intriguing questions emerge from the intersection of seemingly unrelated domains. This exploration into the potential correlation between daily horoscopes and stock market movements serves as a testament to this fact. While the results may not necessarily indicate that the stars guide our financial markets, the exercise underscored the importance of rigorous data analysis, the versatility of sentiment analysis tools, and the myriad ways in which patterns can be teased out of data.

										However, beyond the quantitative findings, this study serves a more profound purpose. It encourages critical thinking, challenges our inherent biases, and sparks curiosity about the world around us. In a rapidly changing financial landscape where data-driven decisions become paramount, it's essential not only to ask the right questions but also to approach answers with an open, yet discerning mind.

										In the end, whether we believe in the predictive power of horoscopes or rely strictly on financial metrics, the journey of exploration and the insights gleaned along the way enrich our understanding and widen our horizons. And in this vast expanse of human knowledge, the true reward often lies in the quest itself.
